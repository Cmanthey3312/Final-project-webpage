        <p class= scott>It’s fairly impossible to name another movie like this one. Scott Pilgrim has to fight his new girlfriend’s “Evil Exes” in order to win her heart. And by fight, I mean fight videogame-style. Which is exactly why I love this movie- I love video games. This movie has a very unique comic book style to it, which means sounds are played out with graphics or words (like when a door slams, “slam” appears), and the Evil Exes that scott fights are treated as levels. It’s such a neat movie, and the dozens of video game references within it only add to its awesomeness.
