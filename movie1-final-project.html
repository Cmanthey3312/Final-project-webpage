        <p class= "district-9">This movie is about alien refugees that come to earth. Itâ€™s not an invasion like War of the Worlds; it has to do more with politics and military experimentation, which is why I like it. No other movie depicts aliens like this, and since the Alien Invasion genre was so played out and running out of ideas at the time, this was the most interesting. The mockumentary part at the beginning of the movie is my favorite part, because mockumentaries are so cool.</p>
