        <p class="spidey">Iâ€™m a huge fan of the Superhero genre, and even though many superhero movies in recent years have been fantastic, this one will always have a special place in my heart. The fight scenes between Doc-Ock and Spidey are some of the most finely choreographed in the entire genre, and way the two play off of each other is so entertaining. This movie was a huge part of my childhood, because this along with the first Spiderman were the first superhero movies I saw, and they are responsible for my intrest in the genre.</p>
