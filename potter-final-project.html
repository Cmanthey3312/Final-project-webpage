        <p class="potter">This is a book that I have much nostagia for. When I was a kid, my dad used to read the Harry Potter books to my sisters and I as a bedtime story. I picked this one in particular because it is the most intense of all the Harry Potter books.his is where the Battle of Hogwarts takes, place, where Voldemort’s horcruxes are killed one by one, and where the Dark Lord is finally defeated. Lots of supporting characters (and even some main characters) are killed off, which makes this book very mature if you compare it to other Harry Potter novels like the Sorcerer’s Stone and the Prisoner of Azkaban.</p>
